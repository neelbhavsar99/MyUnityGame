Battle Ball is a 2D platformer game. The main part of the game is the 2 player-mode which allows two players to verse each other in a game of “basketball”. The two players will be set upon various maps that have 2 nets where the players can score. These maps also have a variety of obstacles that can cause the players to lose possession of the ball. Players can also steal the ball away from each other. There is a timer and when the timer reaches zero, the round is over and the winner with the highest is determined, otherwise it is a tie.

Other than a 2 player-mode, this game also offers an additional  1-player section. This game mode allows the player to run through an obstacle course filled with many challenges to overcome. The main objective of the 1-player mode is to run to the finish point as fast as possible within a given time. There is a timer and if the timer reaches zero, it means that the player has failed to complete the course. If the player reaches the finish point before the timer reaches zero, the player’s name is asked and the time it took them to complete the mode is stored and put in a file that can be read.
