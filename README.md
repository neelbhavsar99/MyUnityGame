## MyUnityGame

Battle Ball is a 2D platformer game. The main part of the game is the 2 player-mode which allows two players to verse each other in a game of “basketball”. The two players will be set upon various maps that have 2 nets where the players can score. These maps also have a variety of obstacles that can cause the players to lose possession of the ball. Players can also steal the ball away from each other. There is a timer and when the timer reaches zero, the round is over and the winner with the highest is determined, otherwise it is a tie.

Other than a 2 player-mode, this game also offers an additional  1-player section. This game mode allows the player to run through an obstacle course filled with many challenges to overcome. The main objective of the 1-player mode is to run to the finish point as fast as possible within a given time. There is a timer and if the timer reaches zero, it means that the player has failed to complete the course. If the player reaches the finish point before the timer reaches zero, the player’s name is asked and the time it took them to complete the mode is stored and put in a file that can be read.

Some of the obstacles in the maps that the player may face include spikes, springs, lava puddles, slippery ice blocks, and etc. One of the biggest features of our game is the two player gameplay. However this game will also include a single player mini-game. The game will feature 3 maps for the 2 player mode as well as one map for the single player mode. Single-Player: This game mode will simply be an obstacle course in which the player must attempt to reach a floating basketball before the countdown timer reaches zero. If it does reach zero, the game is over and the player will have an option to play again. Two-Player: The players can control their 2D characters by using the arrow/WASD keys and can shoot the basketball using the “S” key or the down arrow key.
